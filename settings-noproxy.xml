   | This will determine whether maven prompts you when it needs input. If set to false,

   | Determines whether maven should attempt to connect to the network when executing a build.

  <!-- mirrors
  | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
  |
  | It works like this: a POM may declare a mirror to use in resolving certain artifacts.
  | However, this mirror may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
  | it to several places.
  |
  | That mirror definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
  | mirror, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
  | server for that mirror.
